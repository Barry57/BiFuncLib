Method Description
------------------
FunFEM is a model-based clustering method specifically designed for functional data, such as time series. It employs a discriminative functional mixture (DFM) model that projects the observed curves into a latent functional subspace, where clustering is performed. The key steps of the method are:

- Functional Data Representation

Each observed curve is first smoothed using a basis expansion (e.g., Fourier or spline basis), converting discrete observations into continuous functional forms.

- Discriminative Subspace Learning

A low-dimensional discriminative subspace is identified via a generalized eigenvalue problem, maximizing between-cluster variance while minimizing within-cluster variance (Fisher’s criterion).

- Model Inference (FunFEM Algorithm)

An iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm alternates between:

    1. F-step: Update the discriminative subspace orientation.
    2. M-step: Estimate cluster parameters (means, covariances, and noise variances).
    3. E-step: Compute posterior cluster membership probabilities for each curve.

- Model Selection

The optimal number of clusters (K) and intrinsic dimensionality (d) are selected using the slope heuristic, a data-driven penalty calibration method, which outperforms BIC/AIC in practice.

- Sparse Basis Selection

Optionally, sparsity-inducing regularization (ℓ₁ penalty) is applied to select the most discriminative basis functions (e.g., key time intervals or frequencies) for interpretability.
